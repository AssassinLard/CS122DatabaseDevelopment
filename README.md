# CS122DatabaseDevelopment
Prototype Database for DigiLog
# All files to be named according to their Table Names, and will be compiled at a later date
# Record all changes made to the database files in this README. Spaces will be alloted for each file.

Note from Korean: I finished most parts of creating tables but I need someone to double check the code. 
Specifically:
- dtr -> minutesLate
- foreign keys (especially if we need to add keys in other tables)

And DigiLog Database is the file where I added everything together so... yeah... go check that.
I added dummy values for table employee as well except im missing one value (exepmted_amount)

# Employee

# DTR

# Payroll

# Deduction

# Wage

From Alf: Added php connectivity to the admin_index.php file. 
NOTE: Php will only run natively with .php files so all files we need to use php with and access the database need to be in that format. They're essentially the same as .html files anyway so it shouldn't be too hard to understand.
PENDING: Still don't know how to display the number of lates and absences in the faculty tab, so I'll leave that to Ricci muna. 
PENDING: Will probably convert the other files into .php files just in case.
