# CS122DatabaseDevelopment
Prototype Database for DigiLog
# All files to be named according to their Table Names, and will be compiled at a later date
# Record all changes made to the database files in this README. Spaces will be alloted for each file.

Note from Korean: I finished most parts of creating tables but I need someone to double check the code. 
Specifically:
- dtr -> minutesLate
- foreign keys (especially if we need to add keys in other tables)

And DigiLog Database is the file where I added everything together so... yeah... go check that.
I added dummy values for table employee as well except im missing one value (exepmted_amount)

# Employee

# DTR

# Payroll

# Deduction

# Wage
